    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        DadLAN Australia was established in 2023, bringing together Dads with a common interest in technology,
        computing, games, and family.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our mission is to fight loneliness, improve mental health outcomes, and provide dependable social spaces
        tailored to meet the unique needs of Dads from all walks of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        We provide an uplifting social network and run in-person events for people to experience connection and
        community.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Local Community Engagement
    </h2>

    <p>The DadLAN Events initiative operates via regional chapters, offering in-person gatherings. These social events
        aim to combat isolation, foster connections, and establish a friendly Third Space for fathers. </p>

    <p>Attendees gather regularly to engage in socializing, gaming, and reminiscing about the 'LAN Party' era, among
        other activities. </p>

    <h2>Social Network</h2>

    <p>DadLAN Online program is delivered through digital spaces and provides an uplifting and positive social network.
        We focus on holistic well-being, community, and family. </p>

    <p>The social network provides people an extended community of friends, access to resident experts, and connections
        to professional networks. </p>

        <img src="william.jpg" alt="William Photo">
        <p>William is a dad of two in Sydney and has 20 years of technology experience. He has worked in
            the non-profit space since 2018 with OpenLaw NZ and is passionate about mental welfare in the community. He
            started DadLAN after seeing the success of his wife's mother's group and noticing that there was not
            a similar level of support for Dads.</p>

        <img src="david.png" alt="David Photo">
        <p>David lives in Melbourne with his wife and twin boys. After the birth of his twins, David found that the
            support networks and social connections for fathers were hard to find, create, and maintain. After many
            conversations on the topic, it became apparent that this was a nationwide challenge for many men. Determined
            to make a difference, DadLAN was founded as a way to make a positive impact in men's lives.</p>

        <p>Shawn is a dad of one with over 25 years experience as a programmer and technology executive. He found DadLAN
            while looking for new social groups after moving back to Sydney from a regional area and fell in love with
            the family positive environment and focus on mental health</p>
